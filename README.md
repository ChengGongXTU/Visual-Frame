VISUAL-FRAME: a simple c++ render.

Hiï¼ŒI have created a render framework base on c++ and Window GDI, not need any other graph API and Lib!

This render consist of geometry part, camera part and render part, including som math operators and camera transforms.

The gemetry part is build basing on "pbrt"(writing by MATT PHARR and GREG HUMPHREYS). I will add more function into render part.
